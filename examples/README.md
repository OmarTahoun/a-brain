# Digit recognition in the browser

- wrote a python script that uses the neural network created before and trains it on the mnists data set

- After training the model is saved to a json file which will later be loaded to a JS file.

- Using [P5 Library](https://p5js.org/) we create a canvas for the user to draw a number.

- The data is extracted from the image and fed foward through the neural network.

- based on the output a guess to the user's drawing is made.
