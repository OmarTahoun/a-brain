# A-brain
A machine learning module that implements a multi-layer neural network (MLP).

This will be updated frequently to add new features and fix issues.

Disclaimer: this is for the purpose of learning, currently it's not so optimal but it works.
 
## How Does it Work:
### For info on how does a neural network work I suggest you watch [These 4 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLMP7TazTxHrgVk7w1EKpLBIDoC50QrPS)
### - Three Layers:
  1. Input Layer
  2. Hidden Layer (working on making it have multuple hidden layers)
  3. Output Layer
### - Weights:
  1. The weights are randomized to value between -1 and 1.
  2. The Deltas for the weights are calculated after each iteration.
  3. The weights are then update.
### - Activation: _sigmoid_
  Planing to add more in the future _**(relu, tanh, softmax)**_
